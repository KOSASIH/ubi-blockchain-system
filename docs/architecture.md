# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The Universal Basic Income (UBI) Blockchain System is designed to provide a decentralized platform for implementing a universal basic income model. This document outlines the architecture of the system, including its components, interactions, and technologies used.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface for citizens to access their UBI payments, track transactions, and engage with the system.
- **Key Features**:
  - Responsive design for various devices
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Real-time transaction tracking

### 2. Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Purpose**: Handles API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API for communication with the frontend
  - Integration with blockchain for smart contract interactions
  - User management and transaction processing

### 3. Blockchain Layer
- **Platform**: Ethereum (or other suitable blockchain)
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - **UBI Contract**: Manages the distribution of universal basic income.
  - **Taxation Contract**: Handles taxation on automation and AI-driven productivity gains.
  - **Governance Contract**: Facilitates community governance and decision-making.

### 4. Database
- **Type**: NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)
- **Purpose**: Stores user data, transaction history, and system logs.
- **Key Features**:
  - Scalable and flexible data model
  - Secure storage of sensitive information

## Interaction Flow
1. **User  Registration**: Users register on the frontend, which communicates with the backend to create a new user profile.
2. **UBI Distribution**: The backend triggers the UBI smart contract to distribute payments based on predefined conditions.
3. **Transaction Tracking**: Users can view their transaction history through the frontend, which fetches data from the backend and the blockchain.

## Conclusion
The UBI Blockchain System architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, ensuring that it can adapt to future needs while providing a reliable platform for universal basic income distribution.
